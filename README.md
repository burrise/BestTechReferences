Recommended Technical References for Project
============================================

Some resources are better than others for learning new technology. You can save substantial time and effort if you start with the very best resources.

Look around for books, videos, articles, blogs, etc. for learning about the technologies needed for the project this semester. Edit the file References.txt to include a section with your name and recommended resources for learning about the different technologies we will be using this semester. If your recommendation is the same as someone else's, say what makes it a good reference. You should include at least one new reference.
