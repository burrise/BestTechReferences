=== Some Suggestions by Eddie Burris ========================

The following hands-on tutorial offers a nice introduction to MVC 4:
http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/mvc-4/getting-started-with-aspnet-mvc4/intro-to-aspnet-mvc-4

The following book is a more comprehensive reference:
MVC: Pro ASP.NET MVC 4 (There is a newer version of this book that covers MVC 5. Both should be available on Safari.)

ASP.NET MVC Tutorial
Excellent summary of a database first design to create a website with dynamic content. Links to several more advanced
topics on the same page.

Helpful Git resources:
An excellent summary of critical git commands to get started. Also shows a nice workflow to safely
merge a long term feature into your master branch:
http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging

Another useful tutorial for Git. This one shows the benefits of operating within the command line. If you've made a lot of
changes and have to pull updates, it may be wise to use 'fetch' instead of 'pull' to do so. This way you can preview the 
changes that would be made to your local repository before actually merging them in.

pdfsharp is a .NET library for processing PDF files.  

Per the forum posting:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2937797/best-c-sharp-api-to-create-pdf
This API is open source and licensed by MIT.  Therefore, it can be used in
a corporate setting.

iText# is another API that is highly touted, however it is licensed by AGPL and
any program using it must also be licensed by AGPL.

I also used the asp.net site and went through the tutorials.  There were easy to follow and took you through step by step
with making the web app.  It goes over creating a view, creating a model and creating a controller.  it also
goes over creating tables from classes from your code.
