Instructions: Look around for books, videos, articles, blogs, etc. for learning about the technologies needed for the project this semester. Add a section below that includes your name and the resources you recommend for learning about the different technologies we will be using this semester. If one of your recommendations is the same as someone else's, say what makes it a good reference. You should include at least one new reference that hasn't been mentioned yet.

The following hands-on tutorial offers a nice introduction to MVC 4:
http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/mvc-4/getting-started-with-aspnet-mvc4/intro-to-aspnet-mvc-4

The following book is a more comprehensive reference:
MVC: Pro ASP.NET MVC 4 (There is a newer version of this book that covers MVC 5. Both should be available on Safari.)

I used both these tutorials to help grasp a thorough understanding for GitHub. I used them to get my GitHub account started. I was rather unfamiliar with GitHub so like most people I turned to YouTube tutorials which helped me a great deal.
I was designated as one of the testers for our group project. Here is a brief description on visual studio and unit testing.

ASP.NET MVC Tutorial
Excellent summary of a database first design to create a website with dynamic content. Links to several more advanced
topics on the same page.
http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview

Helpful Git resources:
An excellent summary of critical git commands to get started. Also shows a nice workflow to safely
merge a long term feature into your master branch:
http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging

Another useful tutorial for Git. This one shows the benefits of operating within the command line. If you've made a lot of
changes and have to pull updates, it may be wise to use 'fetch' instead of 'pull' to do so. This way you can preview the 
changes that would be made to your local repository before actually merging them in.

pdfsharp is a .NET library for processing PDF files.  

Per the forum posting:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2937797/best-c-sharp-api-to-create-pdf
This API is open source and licensed by MIT.  Therefore, it can be used in
a corporate setting.

iText# is another API that is highly touted, however it is licensed by AGPL and
any program using it must also be licensed by AGPL.
AGPL Information:
https://www.kuali.co/agpl-licensing-explained/
After reading this article, we may be able to use iText#.  I will confirm with Prof. Burris.

pdfsharp can be downloaded here:

I also used the asp.net site and went through the tutorials.  There were easy to follow and took you through step by step
with making the web app.  It goes over creating a view, creating a model and creating a controller.  it also
goes over creating tables from classes from your code.

=== Suggestions by Raphael Henrique ========================

I also think that the asp.net site is very complete with a good step by step tutorial (http://www.asp.net/mvc)
And if you like video tutorials, I found this video that talks about basics of MVC, basics of how to make some simple operations with the database:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAtVv1Q7ufM

A useful alternative to help you with the user interface would be Bootstrap, it is a html, css and javaScript framework very easy to use, with 
lots of components that you can use like buttons, forms, and also allows you to create responsive designs.

=== Suggestions by Luyen Nguyen ========================

Since our group "The Chinchillas" is doing something a little different then the rest of the class, I wanted to post a reference about Bootstrap that might be helpful to other members of the class.  I agree with Raphael that the bootstrap website is very useful, because they have very good available resources that can help you create a nice webpage. 
http://getbootstrap.com/ 

We tend to be uninterested in certain topics we are not knowledgeable about, but sometimes a good beginners tutorial helps with the learning process.  Heres a good beginners video from YouTube on a demonstration of how bootstrap works.

=== Suggestions by Scott Morris ========================

I think that it is good that we get to implement a database within our project.  A lot of us will be using MySQL for our databases.  Getting to know and understand how to build an efficient database is essential for all of us. These videos from The New Boston are very helpful if you get stuck with your MySQL database.

When trying to learn Git, I found there was an easier way for us Mac users.  You can simply download the Github UI and make changes directly from the UI without having to mess with command line.

When it comes to tutorials, I prefer video tutorials.  For .NET development there are two main sources I use,
one paid, one free.

1. Pluralsight.com is subscription based and offers thousands of .NET related video tutorials.  The videos
are authored by industry experts, many of them Microsoft MVPs.  They are thorough and sometimes hours long.
Here are a few that will be helpful to this project:
    + http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/mvc4
    + http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/aspdotnet-mvc5-fundamentals
    + http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/entity-framework5-getting-started

2. YouTuber kudvenkat: https://www.youtube.com/user/kudvenkat  He has hundreds of .NET related tutorials that
are thorough and detailed.  They are organized into meaningful playlists that take you through entire .NET
technologies.  Here are some helpful ones:
    + Linq to SQL Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6n9fhu94yhXCHPed2Q9oBkgvzw9Re8hC
    + ASP.NET MVC for beginners: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6n9fhu94yhVm6S8I2xd6nYz2ZORd7X2v
    + C# for beginners: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAC325451207E3105

I beleive that Bootstrap does a great job of explaining its many features and how to utilize them, but I am sure
that many of us are used to using W3Schools tutorials. Here is a link to their guide to Bootstrap.
http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/

Also make sure to pay attention to what version of Bootstrap any guide is talking about and that you are using 
the same version. Here a guide to the differences between bootstrap version 2 and 3.

Many resources online, I watched a few videos on exporting from Visual Studio C# to pdf
video 1:

I also found a blog on microsoft.com with the same topic

I think working with our prototype the next few days will get us moving towards a better understanding
of how we are going to go about tackling the features of the application. Basic functionality once we 
have completed the protoype and build from there.  


This reference details how to export data to an Excel spreadsheet using C#.

=== Suggestions by Brien Belko =========================I also think MVC: Pro ASP.NET MVC 5 is an excellent resource.  The first half of the book gives you a step by step, chapter by chapter guide to building an application within ASP.NET MVC.  The second half of the book really dives deep into the concepts deeply. You can find it on safari in the UMKC library databases.http://library.umkc.edu/Tangential to using ASP.NET, I have been using for reference C# 5.0 In A Nutshell: The Definitive Reference.  This book has been incredibly helpful to me as I had never programmed in C# prior to this project.  This also can be found on Safari in the UMKC library databases.http://library.umkc.edu/There is a free guide to Git published by Apress that will tell you everything you wanted to know, and much you wouldn’t, about Git.  It explains the concepts of Git, comes in four different file formats and has a chapter completely dedicated to GitHub.  That and the first few chapters should be enough to make you an expert (for the purpose of this class)http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 ========================================================
