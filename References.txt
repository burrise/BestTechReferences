Instructions: Look around for books, videos, articles, blogs, etc. for learning about the technologies needed for the project this semester. Add a section below that includes your name and the resources you recommend for learning about the different technologies we will be using this semester. If one of your recommendations is the same as someone else's, say what makes it a good reference. You should include at least one new reference that hasn't been mentioned yet.

=== Suggestions by EB ========================

The following hands-on tutorial offers a nice introduction to MVC 4:
http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/mvc-4/getting-started-with-aspnet-mvc4/intro-to-aspnet-mvc-4

The following book is a more comprehensive reference:
MVC: Pro ASP.NET MVC 4 (There is a newer version of this book that covers MVC 5. Both should be available on Safari.)
