Instructions: Look around for books, videos, articles, blogs, etc. for learning about the technologies needed for the project this semester. Add a section below that includes your name and the resources you recommend for learning about the different technologies we will be using this semester. If one of your recommendations is the same as someone else's, say what makes it a good reference. You should include at least one new reference that hasn't been mentioned yet.

The following hands-on tutorial offers a nice introduction to MVC 4:
http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/mvc-4/getting-started-with-aspnet-mvc4/intro-to-aspnet-mvc-4

The following book is a more comprehensive reference:
MVC: Pro ASP.NET MVC 4 (There is a newer version of this book that covers MVC 5. Both should be available on Safari.)

ASP.NET MVC Tutorial
Excellent summary of a database first design to create a website with dynamic content. Links to several more advanced
topics on the same page.
http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview

Helpful Git resources:
An excellent summary of critical git commands to get started. Also shows a nice workflow to safely
merge a long term feature into your master branch:
http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging

Another useful tutorial for Git. This one shows the benefits of operating within the command line. If you've made a lot of
changes and have to pull updates, it may be wise to use 'fetch' instead of 'pull' to do so. This way you can preview the 
changes that would be made to your local repository before actually merging them in.

pdfsharp is a .NET library for processing PDF files.  

Per the forum posting:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2937797/best-c-sharp-api-to-create-pdf
This API is open source and licensed by MIT.  Therefore, it can be used in
a corporate setting.

iText# is another API that is highly touted, however it is licensed by AGPL and
any program using it must also be licensed by AGPL.

pdfsharp can be downloaded here:

I also used the asp.net site and went through the tutorials.  There were easy to follow and took you through step by step
with making the web app.  It goes over creating a view, creating a model and creating a controller.  it also
goes over creating tables from classes from your code.

I also think that the asp.net site is very complete with a good step by step tutorial (http://www.asp.net/mvc)
And if you like video tutorials, I found this video that talks about basics of MVC, basics of how to make some simple operations with the database:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAtVv1Q7ufM

A useful alternative to help you with the user interface would be Bootstrap, it is a html, css and javaScript framework very easy to use, with 
lots of components that you can use like buttons, forms, and also allows you to create responsive designs.

Since our group "The Chinchillas" is doing something a little different then the rest of the class, I wanted to post a reference about Bootstrap that might be helpful to other members of the class.  I agree with Raphael that the bootstrap website is very useful, because they have very good available resources that can help you create a nice webpage. 
http://getbootstrap.com/ 

We tend to be uninterested in certain topics we are not knowledgeable about, but sometimes a good beginners tutorial helps with the learning process.  Heres a good beginners video from YouTube on a demonstration of how bootstrap works.

=== Suggestions by Scott Morris ========================

I think that it is good that we get to implement a database within our project.  A lot of us will be using MySQL for our databases.  Getting to know and understand how to build an efficient database is essential for all of us. These videos from The New Boston are very helpful if you get stuck with your MySQL database.

When trying to learn Git, I found there was an easier way for us Mac users.  You can simply download the Github UI and make changes directly from the UI without having to mess with command line.

I think working with our prototype the next few days will get us moving towards a better understanding
of how we are going to go about tackling the features of the application. Basic functionality once we 
have completed the protoype and build from there.
